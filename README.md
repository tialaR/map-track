# 🗺️ MapTrack — Automated Daily Inspection & PDF Reporting Platform

## About MapTrack

MapTrack was created to automate and modernize inspection reporting for construction professionals.

Instead of manually collecting images, marking areas, writing notes, and assembling reports, MapTrack centralizes everything and produces a unified PDF report, ready to be shared with stakeholders, teams, or clients.

**MapTrack** is a modern React + TypeScript + Vite application designed to help construction professionals streamline daily inspection workflows.

The platform allows users to:

- Mark areas of operation on maps or project images
- Attach inspection photos
- View daily tabulation based on location
- Generate structured PDF reports automatically

MapTrack eliminates repetitive manual work and centralizes daily construction inspection tasks into one efficient system.
